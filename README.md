Practical Application Assignment 5.1 Summary of Findings

### Out of the entire dataset, 57% of the observations accepted a coupon.  Characteristics of higher acceptance rates were:

* Destination was "No Urgent Place"
* Passenger was with a Friend
* Weather was sunny.
* Temperature was 80
* Time was 2PM
* Coupon was Carryout and Take away
* Coupon expired in 1 day
* Younger versus older.
* Marital status was single
* Had Some High School education.
* Had low income.

### A review of those who accepted bar coupons had an overall acceptance rate of 59%.  Characteristics of higher acceptance rates were:

* Destination was "Home.
* Passenger was with Friend.
* Weather was Sunny
* Temperature was 55.
* Time was 6PM and 10PM
* Gender was male.
* Age was less or equal to 31.
* Marital status was single.
* Did not have children.

* Acceptance rates were 71% for those that didn't have a kid passenger.  Also, for those that didn't have a kid passenger and not widowed, the acceptance rate was 71%.  Not having a kid passenger made an impact on acceptance rates.

### Out of the population of coupons for Carryout & Take away, 73% of the observations accepted a coupon.  Characteristics of higher acceptance rates were:

* Destination was "Home".
* Gender was male.
* Weather was sunny.
* Temperature was 80
* Time was 2PM
* Age was 50 and older.
* Coupon expired in 1 day
* Had Some High School education.

* For this segment looked at gender and peak times of 2PM and 6PM versus non peak times.  Acceptance rates were 85% for males with a friend at peak times and 92% for females with a friend.

* Further Investigation

 * I think it would be interesting to see if the number of children had an impact not just if they had kids.  It is likely that income levels and number of children in household could have an affect on coupon acceptance.
 * If traffic data such as number of traffic lights or neighborhood location where lived likely has an affect on the coupons that would be accepted.
